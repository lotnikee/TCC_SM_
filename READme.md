This ReadMe document is to explain what projects are within each folder and to explain the code that is within them. 

The first folder, SM_CW_2 is a folder for the second coursework of the 'Statistical Mechanics' module. 
This coursework includes a question that asks the student to plot the constant volume heat capacity against the temperature for various molecules, and to compare this with values found in the NIST Webbook. 
The code found in this folder is therefore written to do exactly that, taking into account that the values in the NIST Webbook are given in different units and making sure to convert constant pressure heat capacity to constant volume heat capacity to match the example plot given in the question. 

The second folder, SM_CW_project is a folder for the final project of the 'Statistical Mechanics' module. 
This coursework starts with finishing some questions from the second tutorial and then moves on to calculating adsorbance energies for methane on Cu(111). 
The final part of the project includes writing code to run a Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the CO/CH_4 selectivity on a Cu(111) surface. The same is then done using a Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation. 

The last folder, SM_tutorial_2 is the folder that contains the code from the second tutorial, which is needed to answer the first few questions of the final project.
